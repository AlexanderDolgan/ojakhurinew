== Theme Set Up ==

The slider has been revised to use the posts from the featured category.  To initiate the slider simply create a new category called "featured" if  not already implemented or if its new installation. All posts added to  this category will cycle through the slider on the home page. Visit the customizer page to set your options for the slider. Make sure that your posts  have a featured image set and at least 1400px wide images.
By default the slider is set to show 5 latest posts from the category featured.  This can be changed to any number via the settings options on the customizer.
